# Feature Toggles

Starship allows you to have toggles for some additional
services to run with your infra setup. A few of them are
mentioned below.

## Registry

Following the schema of the `cosmos/chain-registry` repos,
if enabled this service spins up a rest api chain-registry service
for the infra you spin up.

### Syntax

```yaml
registry:
  enabled: true  # enable registry service
  localhost: true # default: true, will set chain registry output with api endpoints pointing to localhost, using the chains[].ports for localhost endpoints
  ports:
    rest: 8081   # localhost port for redirecting traffic
  # Optional: resources directive, default cpu: 0.2, memory: 200M
  resources:
    cpu: 0.5
    memory: 200M
  # Optional: image directive, default image:ghcr.io/hyperweb-io/starship/registry:20230614-7173db2
  image: ghcr.io/hyperweb-io/starship/registry:20230614-7173db2
```

> Note: `registry.localhost` is set to true by default, meaning if the ports are specified in chains[].ports, then we set the various api endpoints of the chain registry to `localhost:<port>`. Make sure `rest`, `grpc`, `rpc` are set as [chain ports](https://starship.cosmology.tech/config/chains#ports). If set to false, then it is set to kubernetes internal DNS endpoints.

### Usage

Here is a list of available endpoints and how to use them:

| Endpoint                      | Returns
| ----------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `/chain_ids`                  | List of all chain-ids in the current setup
|`/chains`                      | List of all chain items
| `/chains/{chain}`             | Chain schema for the given chain ids (`name` in the `chains` directive)
| `/chains/{chain}/assets`      | Assets of the given chain
| `/chains/{chain}/keys`        | List of mnemonics used for the setup
| `/ibc`                        | List all ibc info for all chains
| `/ibc/{chain_1}/{chain_2}`    | IBC information between the 2 chains specified

Proto definition for the service is [here](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/blob/main/starship/proto/registry/service.proto)

## Explorer
In order to provide a full fledged emulation environment, we have
a handy toggle to spin up an explorer for the infra.

Currently we support only Ping Pub explorer, but we will be adding more

### Syntax

```yaml
explorer:
  enabled: true  # enable registry service
  type: ping-pub # currently only support for ping-pub explorer
  ports:
    rest: 8080   # localhost port for redirecting traffic
  # Optional: resources directive, default cpu: 1, memory: 2Gi
  resources:
    cpu: 2
    memory: 4Gi
  # Optional: image directive, default image: ghcr.io/hyperweb-io/starship/ping-pub:6b7b0d096946b6bcd75d15350c7345da0d4576db
  image: ghcr.io/hyperweb-io/starship/ping-pub:6b7b0d096946b6bcd75d15350c7345da0d4576db
```

Available versions for the explorer can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/pkgs/container/starship%2Fexposer/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged)

### Usage

After performing `port-forward`, open explorer at: http://localhost:8080

## Ingress
In order to get external traffic into Starship, one can use the `ingress` directive to
create ingress rules on the domain.

> NOTE: Prerequists include installing `cert-issuer` and `nginx-ingress` controller in the k8s cluster.
Domain specified, needs to be pointing to the k8s cluster in which Starship is deployed
For Starship devnets, we use: [`cluster-setup.sh`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/blob/main/starship/scripts/cluster-setup.sh)
as the setup script. Need to run just once.

### Syntax
```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  type: nginx
  # host must be a wildcard entry, so that we can use the wildcard to create
  # service specific ingress rules.
  host: "*.thestarship.io"
  certManager:
    issuer: "cert-issuer"
```

Above will create following endpoints with the domain, and valid certs:
* Explorer at: `https://explorere.<host>` (if enabled)
* Registry at: `https://registry.<host>` (if enabled)
* Chains at:
  * RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.<chain-id>-genesis.<host>`
  * Rest endpoint: `https://rest.<chain-id>-genesis.<host>`
  * Chain exposer: `https://rest.<chain-id>-genesis.<host>/exposer`
  * Chain faucet: `https://rest.<chain-id>-genesis.<host>/faucet`
* Relayers at:
  * Rest endpoint: `https://rest.<relayer-type>-<relayer-name>.<host>`
  * Exposer endpoint: `https://rest.<relayer-type>-<relayer-name>.<host>/exposer`

## Frontends
Starship provides flexible frontend services that can be configured to run alongside your infrastructure.
Frontend services can be customized with different images, ports, and resource allocations.

### Syntax

```yaml
frontends:
  - name: my-frontend
    type: custom
    image: ghcr.io/hyperweb-io/starship/frontend:latest
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      rest: 3000
    env:
      API_URL: http://localhost:8080
    resources:
      cpu: 0.5
      memory: 512Mi
```

### Configuration Options

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | string | Name of the frontend service | Required |
| `type` | string | Type of frontend service (e.g., frontend) | Required |
| `image` | string | Docker image for the frontend service | Required |
| `replicas` | integer | Number of frontend service replicas | 1 |
| `ports.rest` | integer | Port for HTTP/REST traffic | Required |
| `env` | object | Environment variables for the frontend service | {} |
| `resources` | object | Resource limits and requests | See below |

### Resource Configuration

The `resources` field follows the standard Kubernetes resource specification:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "1Gi"
  requests:
    cpu: "0.5"
    memory: "512Mi"
```

### Health Checks

The frontend service includes both readiness and liveness probes:
- TCP socket checks on the configured HTTP port
- Initial delay of 20 seconds
- Check interval of 10 seconds

### Service Configuration

The frontend service is exposed as a ClusterIP service with:
- No cluster IP (headless service)
- HTTP port matching the configured port
- Proper selector labels for service discovery

### Labels and Annotations

The frontend service includes standard Kubernetes labels and annotations:
- `app.kubernetes.io/name`: Service name
- `app.kubernetes.io/type`: Frontend type
- `app.kubernetes.io/version`: Chart version
- Quality, role, SLA, and tier annotations

### Usage

After deployment, you can access the frontend service through:
- Port forwarding: `kubectl port-forward svc/<frontend-name> <local-port>:<frontend-port>`
- Ingress (if configured): `https://<frontend-name>.<host>`
